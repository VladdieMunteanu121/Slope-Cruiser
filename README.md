# Slope-Cruiser
Slope Cruiser is a replica of famous games such as Subway Surfer and Temple Run. 
The objective of the game is to dodge all of the incoming obstacles and remain on the platform until the selected song ends.
Users have the ability to select between three seperate difficulty levels, three unique character styles and three catchy instrumental jams to help them reach the finish line in style. (Note: all three components must be selected in order for the game to launch)
